# PolarFire SoC AMP (Asymmetric Multiprocessing) Examples

This repository contains a number of example applications that showcase the usage of RPMsg (Remote Processor Messaging) framework to send messages between two different software contexts in an AMP configuration.

## AMP Configurations Supported:

- Linux (RPMsg Master) + FreeRTOS (RPMsg Remote)

- FreeRTOS (RPMsg Master) + FreeRTOS (RPMsg Remote)

For more information about AMP and inter-core communication using RPMsg on PolarFire SoC, please refer to the Polar Fire SoC AMP documentation.

## Pre-Requisites
